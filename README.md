# Shop-Billling-Management-System

# Project Description
The Billing System is a C++ console application designed to handle basic billing operations for a retail store. It allows users to add products, manage inventory, generate bills for customers, and calculate the total cost, including applicable taxes. This project demonstrates C++ skills, focusing on object-oriented programming concepts, file handling, and basic data structures.

# Features
1. Product Management: Add, update, delete, and view products in inventory.
2. Customer Billing: Create and generate bills for customers by adding selected products.
3. Inventory Tracking: Tracks product stock levels and updates quantities after each sale.
4. Tax Calculation: Includes tax calculation in the total billing amount.
5. File Storage: Stores product information in a file, allowing data persistence between program runs.

# Technologies Used
1. Language: C++
2. IDE: Any C++ compatible IDE (Visual Studio, Code::Blocks, Dev C++, etc.)

# Usage
1. Add Products: Start by adding products to the inventory, specifying the product name, price, and quantity.
2. Generate Bill:
   Select products to add to the bill.
   Enter the quantities for each product.
   The system will calculate the subtotal, tax, and final total for the customer.
3. Save and Load Data:
   Product data is saved in a file to maintain persistence.
   Each time the program runs, it loads existing product data if available.

# Future Improvements
Some possible enhancements include:

1. Database Integration: Use a database instead of file storage for better data management.
2. GUI Interface: Create a graphical interface for improved user interaction.
3. Discounts and Promotions: Add support for discounts, promotions, and loyalty programs.
4. User Authentication: Implement user authentication for secure access to the billing system.
